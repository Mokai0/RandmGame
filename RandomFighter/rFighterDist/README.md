#For this app you will need:
  - The dependencies located within the pacakage.json file (just run npm install to retrieve them).
  - A stable internet connection is preferable (this is imperative to make things look pretty) but is ultimately not needed.
  - Must have mondgod running in background unless you have mongo running in your shell natively.
  - To start run npm install.
  - Run node public/app.js
