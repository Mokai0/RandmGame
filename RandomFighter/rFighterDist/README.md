#For this app you will need:
  - The dependencies located within the pacakage.json file (just run npm install to retrieve them).
  - A stable internet connection is preferable (this is imperative to make things look pretty) but is ultimately not needed.
  - Must have mondgodb installed and mongod running in background while trying to run this game (unless you have mongo running in your shell natively).
  1] To start run npm install.
  2] Run npm start.
  3] Launch a browser and go to URL localhost:3000  .
  4] Pick a character and play the game to your heart's content, once killed the game will end and ask you to enter your name to your local leaderboard.
  5] To view your leaderboard just go back to the main page: localhost:3000  .
