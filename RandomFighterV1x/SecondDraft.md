#Incorporate a player level up system
[maybe] An alert window that shows 3 buttons:+30hp, +5atk, +5def
[maybe] A constant level up incrementally enhancing the strength of the player proportionate to their skill set
[maybe] A randomized incremental leveling system(either +1hp, +1atk, +1def per kill)

#Incorporate randomized attacks
The hit values should vary in efficacy as well as if they 'hit or miss'
